# codingTasks 

### Name of coding task 
Image Processing of the MNIST dataset 

### Description of task 
The dataset is preprocssed by constrast stretching and normalising the pixels. The dataset is split into training and test set prior to training the Random Forest model with parameters. After training the predicted values are compared to the actual values in a confusion matrix. The parameters are then fine-tuned using GridSearchCV. The best model is again evaulated using a confusion matrix.  

### How to use 
All coding was done in a Jupyter Notebook. 

Libraries used were: numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, sklearn.preprocessing, sklearn.ensemble, sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.metrics, skimage
